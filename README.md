- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Matheus. Currently, I am an undergrad student at Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo - SÃ£o Carlos Institute of Chemistry. I have a 2 year long background on computational 
chemistry studying carbon dioxide adsorption on transition metal clusters. Later, I joined an experimental research group studying the synthesis and characterization of silica
compounds, both funded with a PUB-USP scholarship. Nowadays, I'm currently enrolled in a research internship on post-harvest related technologies.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in mathematical applications of programming and data gathering and analysis.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and a bit of SQL.
