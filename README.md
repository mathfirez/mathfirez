<h1> About me </h1>


- Hi, Iâ€™m Matheus. Currently, I hold a Bachelor degree in Chemistry (with an emphasis on Food Chemistry) @ Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo - SÃ£o Carlos Institute of Chemistry. I have a 2.5 year long background on computational chemistry studying carbon dioxide adsorption on transition metal clusters. 
Later in 2020, I joined an experimental research group studying the synthesis and characterization of silica compounds. Both projects were funded with a PUB-USP scholarship. During 2021, I took a research internship on post-harvest related technologies at EMBRAPA. Nowadays, I'm enrolled in a MBA program in Data Science & Analytics at ESALQ-USP, while working as LIMS Consultant. Currently interested in data science and the development of data-driven applications.
